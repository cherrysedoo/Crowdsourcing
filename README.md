# 🔬 Tokenized Crowdsourcing Research Platform

## Overview

The Tokenized Crowdsourcing Research Platform is an innovative blockchain-based solution designed to revolutionize collaborative research and development. By leveraging blockchain technology and tokenized incentives, the platform creates a transparent, fair, and efficient ecosystem for research contributions.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Decentralized Project Management**
    - Create and manage research projects
    - Multi-phase project support
    - Transparent contribution tracking

- **Token-Based Incentivization**
    - Reward contributors based on their input
    - Traceable and verifiable contributions
    - Fair compensation mechanism

- **Flexible Collaboration**
    - Open-source research collaboration
    - Customizable project parameters
    - Phase-based project progression

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Proof of Transfer)
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Testing Framework**:
    - Vitest
    - Clarinet
- **Frontend (Recommended)**:
    - React
    - TypeScript
    - Web3 Integration

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- Stacks Wallet
- Clarinet CLI

## 🔧 Installation

### Smart Contract Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/research-crowdsourcing-platform.git
cd research-crowdsourcing-platform
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install Clarinet
```bash
npm install -g @stacks/cli
```

### Development Environment

```bash
# Start local blockchain
clarinet integrate

# Run tests
npm test

# Deploy contracts
clarinet deploy
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Creating a Research Project

```clarity
(contract-call? research-crowdsourcing create-project 
  "AI Ethics Research"           ;; Project Name
  "Exploring AI ethical limits"  ;; Description
  u5000                           ;; Initial Funding
  u100                            ;; Contribution Threshold
)
```

### Contributing to a Project

```clarity
(contract-call? research-crowdsourcing contribute-to-project
  u1                              ;; Project ID
  "Machine learning algorithm"    ;; Contribution Description
  u250                            ;; Contribution Value
)
```

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

- Unit tests for each contract function
- Error scenario validation
- Access control testing
- State mutation checks

Run tests using:
```bash
npm test
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Implemented access control mechanisms
- Threshold-based contribution validation
- Phase-based project management
- Error handling for critical operations
